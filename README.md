<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Overview

The objective of this project is to classify hand-written digits from 0 to 9 using various machine learning models and compare their efficiency.


### Requirements

* [Numpy (1.21.5)](http://www.numpy.org/) - Multidimensioanl Mathematical Computing
* [Pandas (1.4.2)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html#) - Access Tabular data
* [Matplotlib (3.5.1)](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) - Used to plot Graph
* [Sklearn (1.0.2)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine learning models

### Dataset
* [OpenML Dataset](https://www.openml.org/d/554) - Dataset for Digit Recognition













## Scope and Limitations
1. This method of digit recognition has errors and might results in incorrection preditions of the handwrittings compared to classification by humans. This misinformation may cause issues when working with real-life applications that require high accuracy in data recognition.
2. The current sample database is limited to the handwritting styles collected. Therefore may not be applicable to certain texts or may result in highly inaccurate predictions.
3. To enhance the performance of this model, more complex and extensive database that contains diverse handwritting styles should be included. 
4. Potential extension of this project may include generalizing the recognition for other handwritten characters, such as alphabets, mathematical symbols, calligraphy, and foreigns characters.
